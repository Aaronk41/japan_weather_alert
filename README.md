# japan_weather_alert

Built a Python backend to load, clean, and merge daily weather data from the Japan Meteorological Agency, working with CSV files fully in Japanese (Shift_JIS encoding). Automated processing of precipitation, temperature, and wind datasets to enable reliable weather monitoring and alert generation. This project highlights my ability to handle multilingual data sources and develop scalable data workflows for real-world applications.
